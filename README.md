ssm.py 

	- handles meshing 
	- builds SSM 


analysis.py

	- calculates volumes for specified meshes 
	- calculates landmark distances and stuff (INCOMPLETE) 


eval.py

	- for evaluation of predicted segmentations 

## TODO 
- propagated images
- propagated meshes
- hausdorff distances 
	- clean up this code

- centerline code with vmtk integration
- centerline code for curvature, automated determination of facial nerve segments 

- establish naming convention for annotations, functionality for having them cached
